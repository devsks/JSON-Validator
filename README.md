## Synopsis
It's a Pushdown Automaton that very quickly determines if a JSON text is syntactically correct. It could be used to check whether a JSON file is syntactically correct or not.It takes a input file as input and shows the error in proper format if any.

## Motivation

We all faces problem when working with JSON expecially when working with API's dependng in JSON.So it's handy to keep a JSON-validator in the terminal itself to make the development process fast.

## Installation
Do the following two things:
- $make
- $ sudo make instal
